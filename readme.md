# Event Calendar
ðŸ“… Final(Capstone) project for Udacity Android Nano Degree

# Description
This app aims to provide a boilerplate app for building a simple and robust app as a calendar for
your event.

Using the provided JSON file (which can be hosted on your server along with Assets for the
event) Event Organizers can manage the content of the App and update it without releasing an
update.

After looking at Google I/O app we had inspiration for building the similar app for our universityâ€™s
Techno-cultural fest. But ran into few hurdles like Time and Resources Required to build a
production-ready app that can be used as an Event calendar, an app in which Event organiser
can update data without releasing an app update.
So I built this, It aims to provide a simple app that can be customized via simple JSON file.

## Building

0. Clone and import into Android Studio

1. get a Awareness API KEY and put it in
`<string name="awareness_api_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_API_KEY</string>`
if you want to use the GeoFence Feature

2. Host you JSON file on public internet, see [demo JSON file here](public-assets/eventdata.json)
(you can use this demo file for testing or during development) [DEMO JSON FILE](https://api.myjson.com/bins/nedbz)
See [JSON file objects/data is explained here](docs/JSON_data_file explained)

3. Put your JSON file URL in
`<string name="data_json_file_url">YOUR_JSON_FILE_URL</string>`

4. Build it

**NOTE : to make signed apk you have to setup keystore [Sign Your App](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html)**

#### I am including a dummy keystore pre configured but do not use that to sign production apps, it is for developemtn use ONLY

5. add your signingConfigs in [build.gradle file](app/build.gradle)
```
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file('KEY_STORE_PATH_GOES_HERE')
        storePassword "YOUR_STORE_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE"
        keyAlias "YOUR_KEY_ALIAS_GOES_HERE"
        keyPassword "YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_GOES_HERE"
    }
}
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        minifyEnabled false
        proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
    }
}
```
6. Distribute to users, to update the content of app Just edit the Hosted JSON file, you can utilise the Geo-fence based notifications feature to broadcast messages to event attendees who are in event location GeoFence
